    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When tomatoes are in season, oven-roasting is a great way to intensify the flavor of tomatoes while increasing
      their shelf-life. However, many recipes call for a low oven and hours of cooking, and yield disappointingly
      leathery tomato halves. We found that by combining a couple of tricks we were able to cut down considerably on the
      cooking time. We sliced the tomatoes into thick rings that created lots of cut surfaces from which water could
      escape. We jump-started the process by placing the tomatoes into a 425 degree oven and then reduced the
      temperature to 300 degrees to let them finish cooking. Finally by increasing the oil to ¾ cup we sped up the rate
      at which water was driven from the tomatoes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pounds large tomatoes, cored, bottom 1/8 inch trimmed, and sliced 3/4 inch thick</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        Arrange tomatoes in even layer on prepared sheet, with larger slices around edge and smaller slices in center.
        Place garlic cloves between tomatoes. Sprinkle with oregano and 1/4 teaspoon salt and season with pepper to
        taste. Drizzle oil evenly over tomatoes.</li>

      <li>Bake for 30 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through baking. Remove sheet from oven. Reduce oven temperature to
        300 degrees and prop open door with wooden spoon to cool oven. Using thin spatula, flip tomatoes.</li>

      <li>Return tomatoes to oven and continue to cook until spotty brown, skins are blistered, and tomatoes have
        collapsed to 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, 1 to 2 hours. Remove from oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.
        Discard garlic and transfer tomatoes and oil to airtight container. (Tomatoes can be refrigerated for up to 5
        days or frozen for up to 2 months.)</li>
    </ol>
